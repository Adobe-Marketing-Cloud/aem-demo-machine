Here are a few of my best tips for women (or indeed anyone) when hitting the slopes or trails.",skigirl.jpg,geometrixx-outdoors:activity/skiing,"Cross-country skiing: Warming up. Don't discount the value of a proper warm-up. If you step out in to the cold and immediately start to exert yourself too much, you are much more likely to get injured. A quick warmup and stretch can work wonders!",Dress for the weather. But not too warmly. Remember that you need to dress warmly enough to be comfortable but not so warmly that you overheat. The best strategy is to layer your clothes so you can adjust them as needed. Alpine skiers should be especially aware of this since while sitting in the chairlift you need to keep warm but when skiing down the piste may not need so much insulation.,Keep hydrated. The main mistake many people make during winter sports is to think that in the cold you don't need as much water. Nothing could be further from the truth. The best solution is to bring a long small thermos of sweetened tea. This is especially important for cross-country skiers.,"Rewards.

And the answer is three simple words: ""layering, layering, layering!""",layeriton.jpg,geometrixx-outdoors:activity/skiing,Layering helps you stay warm and comfortable in a number of ways:,It traps insulating air between the layers,"It wicks away moisture from your skin, keeping you dry. And keeping dry is an important part of keeping warm.","Compared to one thick layer, multiple thiner layers let you adapt to circumstances by removing or opening an out layer when you get too hot.",In most cases three layers are optimal:,A base layer next to your skin that draws away perspiration. The most common materials for this layer are wool or synthetics like polyesther or microfibre fabrics. At Geometrixx we recommend long underwear made from Merino wool. It has excellent wicking ability combined with a natural softness that won't irritate your skin like other wools sometimes do. It is also naturally resistant to odours.,"An insulating layer. This should be made of a breatable insulation like a wool, fleece or down jacket. Depending on the situation we recommend either fleece or down. Fleece provides good insulation and absorbs very little moisture. Down on the other hand provides even better insultaion but is more absorabnt of water. For moderate cold fleece is sufficient, but in very cold dry conditions a down jacket with a thinner fleece layer underneath is the best.","A shell. The shell should be waterproof or at least water-resistant but breatable. We recommend Nortex material. It is waterproof but has micropores that allows water vapour out. In less extreme settings, a breathable polyesther shell can also be used, but these are water-resistant, not truly waterproof. Plastic raincoats and the like should be avoided. They trap moisture in your clothes and next to your skin and before long you are soaking wet and cold.",Short of Layers? Geometrixx-Outdoors has options for every need.

I ended up deciding to just buy the jacket and hope that it came with all the info I needed to make an educated decision and either keep it or send it back for something else. This is what the Slopeside gives you: -Guaranteed waterproof to 10,000 mm -Guaranteed breathability to 10,000 g/m2 -Critically taped 13mm seams Now that's a nice jacket. Needless to say, I kept mine.",iStock_000018314658Small_edit.jpg,,,,,,,,,,

jason.werner@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"If you don't want to spend the extra money for gloves with a warmer pouch, I would suggest taking a pair of one-size-fits-all-liners (if you don't already have some, they cost $2 just about anywhere) and wearing them under your gloves. This way, you can slide the hand warmer between the gloves and not risk irritating your hands. The only drawback is, of course, if you need to grip anything like ski poles the warmers will get in the way. Good luck!",,,,,,,,,,,

ashley.thompson@spambob.com,1,Reply,The Lagos is made of epoxy and does not contain any fiberglass.,,,,,,,,,,,
aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,1,Reply,"The Lagos is an all-epoxy, super light board. That's a good question that I think a lot of people overlook when shopping around for their first board, so good looking out. In addition to the Lagos being a lot lighter than a glass board, it is also way stronger which is an important consideration if you plan on being bad for a while (kidding). Overall, I recommend epoxy. It's more buoyant and if you are one to care about the environment, epoxy decomposes a lot faster than traditional glass. My friend has a GoPro and got this awesome picture of me on my board (it's epoxy).",iStock_000008387990Small_edit.jpg,,,,,,,,,,

andrew.schaeffer@trashymail.com,1,Reply,They twist and lock to tighten at two different points on the telescope.,,,,,,,,,,,
jason.werner@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"In that case, you may have just bought a pair of poles that can't do what you expect them to, which is to stay tight for an entire hike. The twist and lock poles are kind of an outdated technology as far as poles are concerned. The threads inside the locking mechanism are just asking to get worn out or stripped every time you make an adjustment. It's a catch 22. If you don't tighten the poles tight enough, they don't stay at the height they are supposed to. If you tighten the poles too tight, every time you do the threads will become less effective. I would recommend finding a pair of poles that have the FlickLock system. You simply pull a lever out from the pole to adjust, and then clamp it back down to tighten, much like the quick-release lever on bicycle tires and seats.",,,,,,,,,,,
aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,1,Reply,"I agree with Jason on this one, except that there are twist and lock poles out there that actually do work and last a long time. They are called $250 poles. But honestly, if you are going to spend the money, get the FlickLock.",,,,,,,,,,,

weston.mccall@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"In addition to FlickLock, look into poles with the SLS system. This type of extension has an expander/screw combination that you could lean on with your full body weight, and it's not going to go anywhere.

If you are out there looking for snorkeling fins, you won't find much in the silicone free department. However, if you look around for SCUBA fins, you will find a pretty decent selection. The SCUBA fins will offer a heel strap that clicks to tighten, and is made entirely of plastic. The only drawback: you will need to wear neoprene dive boots.
