I ended up deciding to just buy the jacket and hope that it came with all the info I needed to make an educated decision and either keep it or send it back for something else. This is what the Slopeside gives you: -Guaranteed waterproof to 10,000 mm -Guaranteed breathability to 10,000 g/m2 -Critically taped 13mm seams Now that's a nice jacket. Needless to say, I kept mine.",iStock_000018314658Small_edit.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weston.mccall@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"I got last season's version of this jacket and took it up the mountain at least 60 times. If this one is anything like the last one, you will be happy with the waterproof rating. I had zero problems with it, even when I got stuck on the lift one time and was sitting/leaning on it for half an hour straight in a snowstorm. That's about all you need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
james.devore@spambob.com,1,Reply,"Sounds like you're going to hear nothing but greatness about this jacket. I will give the Slopeside my own personal waterproof rating of _built like a brick house.' I have taken this everywhere from snowboarding to hiking in a downpour to sitting in the rain at an outdoor concert. Not only is it completely waterproof, but also I never get too hot or clammy because it ventilates so well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gloves are completely waterproof and have a great drawstring that helps to keep snow out and your body heat out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jason.werner@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"If you don't want to spend the extra money for gloves with a warmer pouch, I would suggest taking a pair of one-size-fits-all-liners (if you don't already have some, they cost $2 just about anywhere) and wearing them under your gloves. This way, you can slide the hand warmer between the gloves and not risk irritating your hands. The only drawback is, of course, if you need to grip anything like ski poles the warmers will get in the way. Good luck!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ashley.thompson@spambob.com,1,Reply,The Lagos is made of epoxy and does not contain any fiberglass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,1,Reply,"The Lagos is an all-epoxy, super light board. That's a good question that I think a lot of people overlook when shopping around for their first board, so good looking out. In addition to the Lagos being a lot lighter than a glass board, it is also way stronger which is an important consideration if you plan on being bad for a while (kidding). Overall, I recommend epoxy. It's more buoyant and if you are one to care about the environment, epoxy decomposes a lot faster than traditional glass. My friend has a GoPro and got this awesome picture of me on my board (it's epoxy).",iStock_000008387990Small_edit.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is this a defect that is covered by my warranty?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jason.werner@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"I can't really tell with the picture, so you'll have to tell me if the pole extensions have a twist and lock or a lever clamp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
andrew.schaeffer@trashymail.com,1,Reply,They twist and lock to tighten at two different points on the telescope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jason.werner@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"In that case, you may have just bought a pair of poles that can't do what you expect them to, which is to stay tight for an entire hike. The twist and lock poles are kind of an outdated technology as far as poles are concerned. The threads inside the locking mechanism are just asking to get worn out or stripped every time you make an adjustment. It's a catch 22. If you don't tighten the poles tight enough, they don't stay at the height they are supposed to. If you tighten the poles too tight, every time you do the threads will become less effective. I would recommend finding a pair of poles that have the FlickLock system. You simply pull a lever out from the pole to adjust, and then clamp it back down to tighten, much like the quick-release lever on bicycle tires and seats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,1,Reply,"I agree with Jason on this one, except that there are twist and lock poles out there that actually do work and last a long time. They are called $250 poles. But honestly, if you are going to spend the money, get the FlickLock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ashley.thompson@spambob.com,1,Reply,"Andrew, we are sorry that you are having trouble with your Longirod Trek poles. The locking mechanism is covered by your warranty. You can either receive a full refund or get replacement poles if yours are defective. We have already emailed you detailed information about getting this issue resolved at your convenience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weston.mccall@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"In addition to FlickLock, look into poles with the SLS system. This type of extension has an expander/screw combination that you could lean on with your full body weight, and it's not going to go anywhere.

aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,1,Reply,"The Pufferfish fins do use silicone, so if you have a silicone allergy then we recommend not purchasing this product. We currently do not have a silicone free fin set, but your question has been forwarded to our procurement department so that we can hopefully offer you an alternative in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
josh.bradley@pookmail.com,1,Reply,"One of my kids has a silicone allergy, so fortunately for you I have already done the research on this! If you are out there looking for snorkeling fins, you won't find much in the silicone free department. However, if you look around for SCUBA fins, you will find a pretty decent selection. The SCUBA fins will offer a heel strap that clicks to tighten, and is made entirely of plastic. The only drawback: you will need to wear neoprene dive boots. They are quite comfy and keep your feet warm, but it is another expense.",iStock_000017623596Small.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
felicia.carter@trashymail.com,1,Reply,"Josh, thanks for the reply. I will definitely look into getting SCUBA fins. I've already accepted the fact that I will have to pay extra on a few things here and there because of my allergy, and this option doesn't sound unreasonable at all. I'm wondering if I can just buy the booties and wear them with silicone snorkeling fins since my skin wouldn't come in contact with the fins at all. Maybe that would save me some money_..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
josh.bradley@pookmail.com,1,Reply,"Felicia, unfortunately that will not work. Snorkeling fins are generally too narrow around the ball of your foot to allow for a bootie. It would be pretty uncomfortable if it were even possible, in my opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I rounded a corner on the trail at about 9:30am when there were very few hikers around, and came within 10 feet of a moose that wasn't too happy to see me and started in my direction. Remembering a ridiculously illustrated, yet informative sign post I read years ago, I ran uphill as fast as I could and got behind the first big tree I could find. I turned around to see the moose charging up the small hill right in my direction. I waved my hands from behind the tree until I heard a hard thud. Looking around the side of the tree, I saw a dejected looking moose walking slowly back down to the trail.

Do you want to spend a little extra or are you looking to do this on a budget (if you don't mind my asking). If you are on a budget, it is probably best to skip Vail and Park City. The Utah resorts on the Salt Lake Valley side are great choices because you can usually find a good deal on a hotel that is only half an hour from the resorts, and the public transit will get you up to the lifts if you don't want to drive.",iStock_000001250549Small.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You generally begin your summit hike from the highest base camp around midnight so that you summit at sunrise. The air is a little easier to breathe at night so there is a method to the madness. Anyway, it can actually get below zero, so I snagged some electrics. I was by far the most comfortable hiker at 4:00am when it got really cold.

Back behind this bowl there are a bunch of snowshoe trails, and some of them get pretty steep. The great thing about the trails, though, is that they are giant one-way loops so you never face oncoming people. One of the trails gets really steep going downhill toward the end.

It's amazing what they can do. It's an art. So, I'll be in Hawaii for three weeks. In addition to the popular spots like Sunset Beach and Waimea, I also plan on hitting up the Banzai Pipeline. I have been hesitant in years past because it is a rather dangerous spot, but I'm feeling pretty confident this year. Ha ha. Kidding. I'm not going to get myself killed.
