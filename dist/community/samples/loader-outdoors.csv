Any help?",,,,josh.bradley@pookmail.com,1,Reply,"The M2121 pedals take a standard MTB cleat. Fortunately, you don't even have to worry about any of that. The pedals are actually packaged with the cleats! All you need to do is buy these pedals and then some MTB compatible shoes. Sometimes, the shoes will come with the cleats as well, depending on the brand. This is handy because you will wear the cleats out.

Is this a defect that is covered by my warranty?",,,,jason.werner@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"I can't really tell with the picture, so you'll have to tell me if the pole extensions have a twist and lock or a lever clamp.",,,,andrew.schaeffer@trashymail.com,1,Reply,They twist and lock to tighten at two different points on the telescope.,,,,jason.werner@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"In that case, you may have just bought a pair of poles that can't do what you expect them to, which is to stay tight for an entire hike. The twist and lock poles are kind of an outdated technology as far as poles are concerned. The threads inside the locking mechanism are just asking to get worn out or stripped every time you make an adjustment. It's a catch 22. If you don't tighten the poles tight enough, they don't stay at the height they are supposed to. If you tighten the poles too tight, every time you do the threads will become less effective. I would recommend finding a pair of poles that have the FlickLock system. You simply pull a lever out from the pole to adjust, and then clamp it back down to tighten, much like the quick-release lever on bicycle tires and seats.",,,,andrew.schaeffer@trashymail.com,2,Answer,,,,,aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,1,Reply,"I agree with Jason on this one, except that there are twist and lock poles out there that actually do work and last a long time.

If you are out there looking for snorkeling fins, you won't find much in the silicone free department. However, if you look around for SCUBA fins, you will find a pretty decent selection. The SCUBA fins will offer a heel strap that clicks to tighten, and is made entirely of plastic. The only drawback: you will need to wear neoprene dive boots. They are quite comfy and keep your feet warm, but it is another expense.",iStock_000017623596Small.jpg,,,felicia.carter@trashymail.com,2,Answer,,,,,felicia.carter@trashymail.com,1,Reply,"Josh, thanks for the reply. I will definitely look into getting SCUBA fins. I've already accepted the fact that I will have to pay extra on a few things here and there because of my allergy, and this option doesn't sound unreasonable at all. I'm wondering if I can just buy the booties and wear them with silicone snorkeling fins since my skin wouldn't come in contact with the fins at all. Maybe that would save me some money_..",,,,josh.bradley@pookmail.com,1,Reply,"Felicia, unfortunately that will not work.
