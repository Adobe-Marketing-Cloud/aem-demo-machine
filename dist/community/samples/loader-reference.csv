I can fully recommend it.larry.a.spiller@pookmail.com/larry.a.spiller,0,Is it ok to combine two GeoPyramids or should I buy the GioBipyramid instead?,I have seen on Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipyramid) that a Bipyramid is essentially two Pyramids glued together. Why should I buy a Bipyramid then if I can simply glue two GeoPyramids together? Is there anything that I should be aware of?iris.r.mccoy@mailinator.com/iris.r.mccoy,1,Reply,"Well, geometrically this is correct, but technically incorrect. GeoBipyramids are made entirely of GeoTriangles, without any glue, which gives them superior strength and durability. Using non industry-strength glue on GeoPyramid will also void your guarantee, so I cannot recommend following this route."olive.d.pixley@spambob.com/olive.d.pixley,0,Shipping times for GeoPrism,"I ordered GeoPrism three weeks ago, but I am still waiting for the shipping confirmation."aparker@geometrixx.info/aparker,1,Reply,Please check your SPAM filter.

Can anyone help me?"aparker@geometrixx.info/aparker,1,Reply,"If you want a bigger dihedral angle, you can still buy a GeoDodecahedron or GeoIcosahedron, but I think there is little use for a dihedral angle that big."iris.r.mccoy@mailinator.com/iris.r.mccoy,1,Reply,You cannot change the dihedral angle in a cube. It is fixed. This is what makes it a cube.leslie.d.dufault@trashymail.com/leslie.d.dufault,1,Reply,"Sorry for the Newbie question, but what is the dihedral angle?"aparker@geometrixx.info/aparker,1,Reply,"No problem, this is the angle between the sides of the cube."keith.m.mabry@spambob.com/keith.m.mabry,0,GeoCube: Which side is up?,"I just got my GeoCube, but I wonder which side is up. They all look the same."aparker@geometrixx.info/aparker,1,Reply,Did you read the manual? It does not matter. They all look the same because they are 100% identical GeoSquares.

Eight seems a bit much to me.aparker@geometrixx.info/aparker,1,Reply,"No, you can't remove corners, but you can buy our GeoPyramid with an octagonal base, this will give you a three-dimensional Septagon."leonard.a.duncan@mailinator.com/leonard.a.duncan,0,How does trunction work?,I've read something about truncation - and it can be used to transform an Icosahedron. Is that true?aparker@geometrixx.info/aparker,1,Reply,"Yes, in fact our GeoIcosahedrons are sometimes truncated to create Soccer balls.
