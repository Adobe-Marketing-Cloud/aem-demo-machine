aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,0,ski-like-a-girl,/content/dam/fragments,"Yes, I ski like a girl","To get the most out of ski season, you should follow a few simple rules. Here are a few of my best tips for women (or indeed anyone) when hitting the slopes or trails.",geometrixx-outdoors:activity/skiing,"Cross-country skiing: Warming up. Don't discount the value of a proper warm-up. If you step out in to the cold and immediately start to exert yourself too much, you are much more likely to get injured. A quick warmup and stretch can work wonders!",Dress for the weather. But not too warmly. Remember that you need to dress warmly enough to be comfortable but not so warmly that you overheat. The best strategy is to layer your clothes so you can adjust them as needed. Alpine skiers should be especially aware of this since while sitting in the chairlift you need to keep warm but when skiing down the piste may not need so much insulation.,Keep hydrated. The main mistake many people make during winter sports is to think that in the cold you don't need as much water. Nothing could be further from the truth. The best solution is to bring a long small thermos of sweetened tea. This is especially important for cross-country skiers.,"Rewards.

aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,0,summer-training,/content/dam/fragments,Summer Training,See what our own staff members do to beat the heat.,geometrixx-outdoors:activity/surfing,We asked our staff to give us their tips for summer training. Here are some of the responses:,"Heidi: ""I like to go running in the evening when things cool down. I usually wear my Mombasa trainers because they have the best support.""","Jonah: ""When I go biking I ride a Geometrixx Cajamara 27 speed. And I always wear my Tacna helmet!""","Zoltan: ""I'm a surfer. When I hit the beach on the Big Island I have to be prepared. So, I work out regularly and make sure my board is in good shape. Also, remeber to always check for sharks!""","Ingrid: ""I grew up in the mountains so in the winter I ski, but in the summer I go hiking. Obviously the most important thing to have is a good pair of hiking boots. Make sure they have a stiff sole and lot's of ankle support. You maz thing running shoes are good enough, but 10 minutes covering rocky uneven ground and you'll wish you'd brought the right equipment""","Be PreparedTo make sure you have the right equipment this summer, Geometrixx-Outdoors is offering a $10 discount.

aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,0,layer-it-on,/content/dam/fragments,Layer It On,"If there is one question we get the most concerning our winter sports and recreation products it's this: ""What's the best way to keep warm?"" And the answer is three simple words: ""layering, layering, layering!""",geometrixx-outdoors:activity/skiing,Layering helps you stay warm and comfortable in a number of ways:,It traps insulating air between the layers,"It wicks away moisture from your skin, keeping you dry. And keeping dry is an important part of keeping warm.","Compared to one thick layer, multiple thiner layers let you adapt to circumstances by removing or opening an out layer when you get too hot.",In most cases three layers are optimal:,A base layer next to your skin that draws away perspiration. The most common materials for this layer are wool or synthetics like polyesther or microfibre fabrics. At Geometrixx we recommend long underwear made from Merino wool. It has excellent wicking ability combined with a natural softness that won't irritate your skin like other wools sometimes do. It is also naturally resistant to odours.,"An insulating layer. This should be made of a breatable insulation like a wool, fleece or down jacket. Depending on the situation we recommend either fleece or down. Fleece provides good insulation and absorbs very little moisture. Down on the other hand provides even better insultaion but is more absorabnt of water. For moderate cold fleece is sufficient, but in very cold dry conditions a down jacket with a thinner fleece layer underneath is the best.","A shell. The shell should be waterproof or at least water-resistant but breatable. We recommend Nortex material. It is waterproof but has micropores that allows water vapour out. In less extreme settings, a breathable polyesther shell can also be used, but these are water-resistant, not truly waterproof. Plastic raincoats and the like should be avoided. They trap moisture in your clothes and next to your skin and before long you are soaking wet and cold.",Short of Layers? Geometrixx-Outdoors has options for every need.

donna.billups@pookmail.com,0,surfing-super-bowl,/content/dam/fragments,The Super Bowl of surfing,"Aaron thanks a ton for creating this community. I was thinking about doing the same, but then I thought that we wouldn't get the numbers. I look forward to many great discussions with you and anyone else who is passionate about surfing.",geometrixx-outdoors:activity/surfing,"I would be jealous of your trip out to Oahu, but I've got my own vacation lined up. In fact, I'm packing right now to go hang out and watch the pros at the Triple Crown. I'll get some time in on the waves, too, but I love to watch the best in the world tear it up. It's amazing what they can do. It's an art.","So, I'll be in Hawaii for three weeks. In addition to the popular spots like Sunset Beach and Waimea, I also plan on hitting up the Banzai Pipeline. I have been hesitant in years past because it is a rather dangerous spot, but I'm feeling pretty confident this year.",Ha ha. Kidding. I'm not going to get myself killed. I'll take pics of the pipeline but that's it. Please let me know how your trip goes and I will be sure to post some pictures when I get back!,,,,,,
aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,0,surfs-up,/content/dam/fragments,Surfs up! I love November!,"Welcome to my surfing community, where the water is always warm and okay. I burned myself out on the whole creative writing gig with the community about page. I love surfing as much as anything else on this planet, and I look forward to sharing my adventures with you. If you haven't ever surfed, get on a board. All of you floating around out there in the communities who are down to ski, snowboard, skateboard, or longboard should definitely catch a wave any chance you can get. The transition isn't that difficult as long as you have the core/balance that it takes to carve the side of a mountain at a decently high speed.",geometrixx-outdoors:activity/surfing,"Why do I love November? I'll tell you why: the North Shore. This is when Oahu becomes the premier surf spot in the world. The waves don't get better than the stretch of beaches (about 7 miles) on the North Shore in November and usually through February, but November through December is definitely prime. Santa got it wrong by posting up in the North Pole.","Anyway, I booked my ticket to leave right after Christmas. Can't wait!",,,,,,,
rebekah.larsen@trashymail.com,0,best-gps,/content/dam/fragments,Best GPS for hiking?,"I want to buy my husband a GPS navigator as a gift. He is an avid hiker and is always talking about how great it would be to have one. I don't know a lot about the technology or options available out there, and I am hoping for a little advice backed by experience.",,,,,,,,,,
andrew.schaeffer@trashymail.com,0,redwoods,/content/dam/fragments,Enjoying the redwoods,"I remember visiting the redwood forests in Northern California as a kid with my family, but I got the sudden urge to go back and see them for myself, the way I want to see them hiking!",,"I have got to say, if you haven't ever done this before, you need to make the trip. The trees are incredible. They make you feel almost like you're on a different planet. I decided that if I went I wanted to see the granddaddy of them all the Hyperion. This is the tallest tree in the world, and stands at 379'. It's quite a hike. I think it ended up being about 16 miles round trip, so it ends up being a camping hike unless you're an animal.","Anyway, I've stood at the base of the Empire State Building and the Sears Tower, and nothing compares to standing next to this tree.",,,,,,,
weston.mccall@dodgit.com,0,got-poles,/content/dam/fragments,I finally gave in and got poles.,"For anyone out there who may know me and has even hiked with me, you will know that I am what most people would consider to be a minimalist hiker. Running shoes, basketball shorts, and a t-shirt are about all I need to get by. However, if you know me that well you will also know that I have had a small knee issue lately, especially when it comes to long stretches of downhill trail.",,"I have believed, and always will believe that the best way to enjoy nature is without all the expensive gear and latest hiking ""technology."" We didn't need it before it existed, and we certainly don't need it now. That said, when my knees started causing problems, I opted for a nice, sturdy hiking stick off the side of my favorite local trail. However, my wife decided that she would still buy me a set of hiking poles, and insisted that I try them at least once.","Okay. So. Maybe the technology guys are on to something. After one eight-mile hike with the Longirod Trek hiking poles, my knees felt 10 years younger. I'm still a minimalist, but I think there is room for one exception.",,,,,,,
felicia.carter@trashymail.com,0,yellowstone,/content/dam/fragments,Yellowstone in the fall,"My family and I just returned from a trip up to Yellowstone National Park. A family that hikes together stays together _ All our kids are grown now, so we can do some of the more strenuous hikes. We decided to take on Sepulcher Mountain, an 11-mile, all-day hike with a 9,600' summit. This was my first time on this trail, and I can't even begin to tell you how beautiful it was.",,"We definitely chose to go at the right time of year. The leaves are absolutely incredible, and the fire season is far enough behind us that the air up there is crisp and clear as can be. Has anyone else hiked Sepulcher? If you are interested or have any questions about the hike, I would be happy to chat with you. One thing to consider: this is a_cold_hike.",,,,,,,,
josh.bradley@pookmail.com,0,kili-hike,/content/dam/fragments,Gearing up for my Kili hike.,"Hey everyone, my name is Josh and this is my first post in the hiking community. I just wanted to first say thanks to Jason for organizing this community, and that I also could not agree more with what you said about how friendly hikers are, in general. That, too, is one of the reasons I enjoy hitting the trail as often as I do.",,"Anyway, for the past year I have been planning and organizing my first trip to Africa, where I will be hiking Mt. Kili in Tanzania. I've gotta say, I kind of didn't know what I was getting myself into! Even though we (I am taking my son) will be renting a decent amount of equipment from our guide company like our tent, sleeping bags, hiking poles, and cookware, it is still amazing how much we have to bring. I'm a little worried about making it all fit with all the bag restrictions.","Anyway, we leave in a little over a month, and I don't want this to become a ""bad stress"" type of thing, so if there is anyone out there who has some pretty good advice, I would be grateful. Thanks.",,,,,,,
jason.werner@dodgit.com,0,hiking-community,/content/dam/fragments,Thanks for dropping by the hiking community.,"I'm glad you decided to stop by and see how things are going in the hiking community. I organized this community knowing that it would be a great place for fellow hikers to gather and discuss anything and everything related to one of the greatest outdoor past times ever. The more people contribute, the more successful this community will be, so don't be shy.",,"One of my favorite aspects of hiking goes beyond even the most breathtaking views of nature that I have come across over 30 years on the trail. I am, of course, speaking about how great all of you out there are to be around. It is very rare to find an activity or hobby in life (especially a sport) where it seems that just about every participant is just as nice and welcoming as the last. Whether we exchange a simple ""hello"" or ""good morning,"" or we chat about the trail and share some personal knowledge, I am always happy to come across a fellow hiker enjoying his or her day.","So, like I said, don't be shy. We're all excited to hear from you!",,,,,,,
boyd.larsen@dodgit.com,0,skier-switch,/content/dam/fragments,A skier makes the switch,"Call me traditional. Call me old school. I've been a skier all my life, and proud of it. However, I_finallydecided that this is the year I make the switch. I've never strapped into a snowboard, but I'm going to give it a shot.",,"I think it's a good thing that I have waited so long. Now that I have had an outside perspective of snowboarders, watching them on the mountain while I'm on my skis, I think that I will be better off. For instance, I won't just stop in the middle of the run and plant my butt in the snow, because I already know that oncoming skiers get really, really frustrated when that happens!","I am incredibly curious to see how it will be having my feet basically locked together_a new experience, indeed. Who else out there was a skier first who then took up snowboarding?",,,,,,,
jason.werner@dodgit.com,0,avalance,/content/dam/fragments,Avalanche season is upon us,"As we gear up for the winter season, and it looks like it will be a good one, remember that safety is always priority #1. Wherever you decide to go, be sure to check with local officials first to see if there are any avalanche warnings in effect.",,"Almost all the ski resorts in Utah are scheduled to open early this year due to significant snowpack before Thanksgiving, but with early snow comes moderate to considerable avalanche warnings. Jason is putting together an avalanche safety and first aid/CPR review. I would strongly suggest to everyone over here in winter sports connect with Jason for more info.",,,,,,,,
josh.bradley@pookmail.com,0,wintersports,/content/dam/fragments,Welcome to the winter sports community (and lets talk snowshoes)!,"This is the inaugural journal entry for the winter sports community. I hope that every one of you finds exactly what you're looking for, and if you don't, we'll work hard to make sure you do.",,"To begin, I would like to get the conversation started on snowshoeing. Compared to other winter sports, snowshoeing isn't exactly popular, but I'm here to change that! I'm confident that most of you would love breaking through fresh powder on a sunny weekend morning if you just give it a shot.",My son and I are making our own snowshoes this year. It's a great activity and I've spent many years refining my formula for the perfect snowshoe. I'm even going to host a Snowshoeing: 101 class if anyone is interested. Check the calendar for more details.,"Anyway, now you know a little bit more about me. I can't wait to see what this community becomes.",,,,,,
