I ended up deciding to just buy the jacket and hope that it came with all the info I needed to make an educated decision and either keep it or send it back for something else. This is what the Slopeside gives you: -Guaranteed waterproof to 10,000 mm -Guaranteed breathability to 10,000 g/m2 -Critically taped 13mm seams Now thatês a nice jacket. Needless to say, I kept mine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,weston.mccall@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"I got last season's version of this jacket and took it up the mountain at least 60 times. If this one is anything like the last one, you will be happy with the waterproof rating. I had zero problems with it, even when I got stuck on the lift one time and was sitting/leaning on it for half an hour straight in a snowstorm. That's about all you need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,james.devore@spambob.com,1,Reply,"Sounds like you're going to hear nothing but greatness about this jacket. I will give the Slopeside my own personal waterproof rating of ‰built like a brick house.' I have taken this everywhere from snowboarding to hiking in a downpour to sitting in the rain at an outdoor concert. Not only is it completely waterproof, but also I never get too hot or clammy because it ventilates so well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ryan.palmer@spambob.com,1,Reply,I'm happy to hear all of you have great things to say about your jackets because mine was a huge disappointment. The seams leak like crazy. I'm so happy because now I know I got a dudãdefinitely using my warranty and sending mine back for a replacement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,emily.andrews@mailinator.com,0,Blackcomb Gloves,Do the Blackcomb gloves have a pocket for hand warmers?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,boyd.larsen@dodgit.com,1,Reply,Nope. You need to spend about $100 to get a hand warmer pouch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,1,Reply,You can just shove the hand warmer in the glove without the pocket!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,felicia.carter@trashymail.com,1,Reply,"These gloves do not have hand warmers, but I have found with them that you don't really need the warmers, and I consider myself one to get cold pretty easily, especially in my fingers and toes. The gloves are completely waterproof and have a great drawstring that helps to keep snow out and your body heat out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,jason.werner@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"If you don't want to spend the extra money for gloves with a warmer pouch, I would suggest taking a pair of one-size-fits-all-liners (if you don't already have some, they cost $2 just about anywhere) and wearing them under your gloves. This way, you can slide the hand warmer between the gloves and not risk irritating your hands. The only drawback is, of course, if you need to grip anything like ski poles the warmers will get in the way. Good luck!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,weston.mccall@dodgit.com,0,Lagos mini longboard,Is the Lagos mini longboard surfboard epoxy or fiberglass?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ashley.thompson@spambob.com,1,Reply,The Lagos is made of epoxy and does not contain any fiberglass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,emily.andrews@mailinator.com,0,m2121 pedals,"I would be interested in buying the M2121 pedals, but I need to know what type of cleats they pair with first. Any help?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,josh.bradley@pookmail.com,1,Reply,"The M2121 pedals take a standard MTB cleat. Fortunately, you don't even have to worry about any of that. The pedals are actually packaged with the cleats! All you need to do is buy these pedals and then some MTB compatible shoes. Sometimes, the shoes will come with the cleats as well, depending on the brand. This is handy because you will wear the cleats out. I have the M2121 and this is a picture of my setup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,andrew.schaeffer@trashymail.com,0,Longirod Trek hiking poles,"I am having trouble with my Longirod Trek hiking poles. I tighten the extension locks as tight as I can, but they still loosen up after only an hour of use. Is there a trick to this that I need to know about? Is this a defect that is covered by my warranty?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,jason.werner@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"I can't really tell with the picture, so you'll have to tell me if the pole extensions have a twist and lock or a lever clamp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,andrew.schaeffer@trashymail.com,1,Reply,They twist and lock to tighten at two different points on the telescope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,jason.werner@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"In that case, you may have just bought a pair of poles that can't do what you expect them to, which is to stay tight for an entire hike. The twist and lock poles are kind of an outdated technology as far as poles are concerned. The threads inside the locking mechanism are just asking to get worn out or stripped every time you make an adjustment. It's a catch 22. If you don't tighten the poles tight enough, they don't stay at the height they are supposed to. If you tighten the poles too tight, every time you do the threads will become less effective. I would recommend finding a pair of poles that have the FlickLock system. You simply pull a lever out from the pole to adjust, and then clamp it back down to tighten, much like the quick-release lever on bicycle tires and seats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,1,Reply,"I agree with Jason on this one, except that there are twist and lock poles out there that actually do work and last a long time. They are called $250 poles. But honestly, if you are going to spend the money, get the FlickLock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,emily.andrews@mailinator.com,1,Reply,"Andrew, we are sorry that you are having trouble with your Longirod Trek poles. The locking mechanism is covered by your warranty. You can either receive a full refund or get replacement poles if yours are defective. We have already emailed you detailed information about getting this issue resolved at your convenience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,weston.mccall@dodgit.com,1,Reply,"In addition to FlickLock, look into poles with the SLS system. This type of extension has an expander/screw combination that you could lean on with your full body weight, and it's not going to go anywhere. I've been using poles with SLS for a few years now for both summer and winter hiking (my buddy took this picture of me while we were out last time) and I have had zero complaints.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,rebekah.larsen@trashymail.com,0,Aqua Force GPS,Does anyone know if the Aqua Force GPS monitor can log multiple runs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,josh.bradley@pookmail.com,1,Reply,"Yes. The Aqua Force is capable of storing four runs at a time. Your runs logged will detail the time of the run, distance traveled, and elevation gained or lost. It's a pretty handy little function that I use all the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,felicia.carter@trashymail.com,0,Pufferfish fins,"I would like to know the materials used in the Pufferfish fins. Unfortunately, I am allergic to silicone and need to make sure the skirt and strap around the ankle won't be a problem for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,emily.andrews@mailinator.com,1,Reply,"The Pufferfish fins do use silicone, so if you have a silicone allergy then we recommend not purchasing this product. We currently do not have a silicone free fin set, but your question has been forwarded to our procurement department so that we can hopefully offer you an alternative in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,josh.bradley@pookmail.com,1,Reply,"One of my kids has a silicone allergy, so fortunately for you I have already done the research on this! If you are out there looking for snorkeling fins, you won't find much in the silicone free department. However, if you look around for SCUBA fins, you will find a pretty decent selection. The SCUBA fins will offer a heel strap that clicks to tighten, and is made entirely of plastic. The only drawback: you will need to wear neoprene dive boots. They are quite comfy and keep your feet warm, but it is another expense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,felicia.carter@trashymail.com,1,Reply,"Josh, thanks for the reply. I will definitely look into getting SCUBA fins. I've already accepted the fact that I will have to pay extra on a few things here and there because of my allergy, and this option doesn't sound unreasonable at all. I'm wondering if I can just buy the booties and wear them with silicone snorkeling fins since my skin wouldn't come in contact with the fins at all. Maybe that would save me some moneyÑ..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,josh.bradley@pookmail.com,1,Reply,"Felicia, unfortunately that will not work. Snorkeling fins are generally too narrow around the ball of your foot to allow for a bootie. It would be pretty uncomfortable if it were even possible, in my opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,weston.mccall@dodgit.com,0,Whistler Snowboard,"If I buy the Whistler Snowboard, can I switch out the bindings or am I stuck with the ones it comes with?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,1,Reply,"The Whistler is compatible with just about any binding setup out there, with the exception of Burton. If you get the Whistler, you will have four screw holes to attach the baseplate to, which is almost universal (Burton only has three holes).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ryan.palmer@spambob.com,1,Reply,I changed out the bindings when I got the Whistler because I don't like the straps (they bother my ankles). I had no issues attaching my step bindings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ashley.thompson@spambob.com,0,Sequoia helmet,I would like to know if there is an impact rating for the Sequoia helmet. Does anyone know where I can find this info?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ryan.palmer@spambob.com,1,Reply,"I bought this helmet, and on the packaging it reads, _The Sequoia is made of a fully reinforced, singular structure that disperses impact across multiple nerves between the vents for maximum protection.î It doesn't say anything specific about an impact rating, like a numerical value, but I hope that helps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,aaron.mcdonald@mailinator.com,1,Reply,"Our helmets are put through rigorous impact tests to ensure that all our products meet the most stringent safety standards. To test our helmets, we drop each one from a minimum of 7'Êso that it reaches at least 20 ft./secÊand measure the results as per safety regulations published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Requirements for Bicycle Helmets.
