This is where you should put your AEM loads and snapshots. Just give them a simple file name as you will use them in your ANT commands, e.g.

aem6-load17.jar
aem6-load18.jar
snapshot.jar
aem60.jar
aem61.jar
aem62.jar

You can also put service packs in there. Use the same file name as above, with the -sp suffix, e.g.:

aem60-sp.zip
aem61-sp.zip

These service packs will be installed automatically when building your demo environment.
