This is where you should put your AEM license files, with the following names:

For AEM 6.x:
license-aem6.properties

For CQ 5.x:
license-cq5.properties

A default license file name is part of your build.properties file. It can also be overridden at runtime with the -Ddemo.license=[filename] property
